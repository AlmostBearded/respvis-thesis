\label{chap:ResponsiveInformationVisualization}

A \emph{responsive} visualization is a visualization which adapts
itself to the available display space and properties of the device
used to access it. Analogous to responsive web design, the need for
responsive visualizations arises from the growing variety of devices
used to consume content and the physical differences between them.
Visualizations and charts often form significant blocks of content
embedded inside web pages. For a web page to be responsive, any
embedded content such as visualizations and charts must also be
responsive.

Visual elements require proper sizing and spacing to be of
value. Merely scaling visualizations to fit into their allocated space
is insufficient to provide a seamless experience to users, as has
already been discussed in Section~\ref{sec:RWD}. Another factor which
is often ignored is the different methods of interaction inherent to
specific types of devices, such as touch and keyboard interaction. For
example, to ensure that data points remain selectable on less precise
input devices such as touchscreens, a visualisation might adapt by
reducing the data density and increasing the size of individual
elements. The goal of responsive visualizations is that they should
adapt themselves to the characteristics of the consuming device and
context so as to remain as effective and usable as possible
\parencite{DesignPatternsTradeOffsRespVis}.


The topic of responsive visualization only gained prominence in recent
years, as responsive web design became mainstream.
\textcite{BuildingRespDataVisForTheWeb} used the term responsive
visualization, but only descibed how to implement scalable
visualizations. \textcite{LearningRespDataVis} covered scalable
visualizations, but also considered interactive selection and touch
events. The work by Andrews
\parencite{RespVisTalk,RespVisPage,RespVis} was possibly the first
academic work to address design patterns for responsive visualization.
%
More recently, \parencite{TechniquesForFlexibleRespVisDesign} surveyed
the design space of responsive visualizations, created a taxonomy of
currently used techniques and recurring patterns, and presented a tool
to help design responsive visualisations side-by-side. In addition to
surveying design patterns, \textcite{DesignPatternsTradeOffsRespVis}
also consider issues around different forms of \enquote{message loss}
when reducing chart complexity.





\section{Responsive Visualization Patterns}

Patterns are templates for solving recurring problems.
\textcite{TechniquesForFlexibleRespVisDesign} created a comprehensive
taxonomy of responsive techniques, as well as a tool to help design
responsive visualisations side-by-side. They proposed describing
responsive techniques according to five \emph{actions}, which are
applied to different components. These actions are: (1) resize, (2)
reposition, (3) add, (4) modify and (5) remove. A sixth action refers
to leaving a component unchanged, but this is deemed a non-technique
and therefore left out here. They also described a non-exhaustive set
of eleven \emph{components}, upon which these actions can be
performed: (1) axis, (2) axis labels, (3) axis ticks, (4) gridlines,
(5) legend, (6) data, (7) marks, (8) labels, (9) title, (10) view, and
(11) interaction. It should be noted that some combinations of actions
and components do not make sense and therefore do not occur in
practice. It is, for example, not possible to resize interactions or
reposition data.  \textcite{TechniquesForFlexibleRespVisDesign}
performed their research following a desktop-first approach of
responsive design, because the interviews they conducted with
visualization authors revealed a strong inclination towards this
approach. They found that when adapting desktop visualizations for
narrow screens, it was much more common to remove elements (37.7\%)
than to add them (11.3\%). Another interesting finding was that most
visualizations (88.7\%) implemented no change at all for their
interactions, while some (10\%) even removed interactive capabilities
completely. Only very few visualizations (5.6\%) improved the
experience of mobile users by adapting interactions accordingly.



The most detailed research on patterns in responsive visualization
design was performed by \textcite{DesignPatternsTradeOffsRespVis}.
Following \textcite{TechniquesForFlexibleRespVisDesign}, they
characterised the responsive visualization strategies according to
(the same) two dimensions: \emph{targets}, representing what entity is
changed, and \emph{actions}, representing how entities are changed.
However, the targets and actions are more finely grained, having a
number of sub-categories.
%
Targets are grouped into five distinct categories (Data, Encoding,
Interaction, Narrative, and References/Layout), with four of the five
categories further divided into sub-categories, as shown in
Table~\ref{tab:PatternsTargets}.
%
Actions are also grouped into five distinct categories (Recompose,
Rescale, Transpose, Reposition, and Compensate), with four of the five
top-level categories again having sub-categories, as shown in
Table~\ref{tab:PatternsActions}. The actions are defined as operations
with distinct input and output states to ensure they can be inverted,
and thus can be applied to either desktop-first or mobile-first design
approaches
%
Categorizing techniques using these dimensions, the authors identified
a total of 76 viable strategies, whereby some of them are not used in
the visualizations they studied. However, their explorable online
gallery \parencite{DesignPatternsTradeOffsRespVisGallery} contains
examples demonstrating all these patterns.

\section{Responsive Visualization Examples}

% KA you need to gather two or three real-world examples yourself,
% by following the URLs in the responsive-vis-gallery !!

The goal of this section is to provide the reader with some
demonstrative examples of responsive visualizations.  The figures in
this section were taken from external scientific sources which put
most of their effort into demonstrating responsive visualization
patterns rather than communicating messages in the data they used.
Owing to this, some figures below are lacking essential features, such
as titles and axes descriptions, which would usually be present in
practice.


The examples in this section are organized by chart type. It would be
an immense endeavor to bring examples for every pattern used for all
types of charts, so only a subset which demonstrates some of the most
frequently encountered patterns for frequently used types of charts is
summarized here.

\subsection{Bar Charts}
\label{sec:BarChartExamples}

Bar charts are very widespread, accounting for 135 (= 36\%) of the 378
responsive charts in the corpus collected by
\textcite{DesignPatternsTradeOffsRespVis}. Bar charts are usually used
to visualize two-dimensional data, with one categorical dimension and
one quantitative dimension. Two variants of bar charts support the
visualization of categorical datasets having subdimensions: grouped
bar charts \parencite{GroupedBar} compare subdimensions with each
other, and stacked bar charts \parencite{StackedBar} compare
part-to-whole relationships of the subdimensions. Even though
responsive design of visualizations is slowly becoming more common,
most charts found in today's web articles are still created as static
images \parencite{HBar,VBar,HVBar,MapBarLine}.

A good example of a responsive bar chart can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:RespBarExample} \parencite{RespVis}. Bar charts are
freely scalable by adjusting the width of individual bars
\parencite{RespHBar,RespHBarHLine,RespHBars}, so they all can fit into
their allocated space. When reducing the width of any type of chart
past a certain point, the tick labels of the horizontal axis may start
to overlap. This is why the reducing width pattern usually occurs
together with the recompose axis ticks and simplify/elaborate axis
labels patterns \parencite{RespHBars,RespHBarHLine,RespVBar}. Another
effective pattern for avoiding overlapping tick labels is to rotate
the labels by up to 90 degrees tso they take up less horizontal space
\parencite{RespVis}. If there is too much data to fit into the
available width, the chart can be transposed and grown to as much
height as is required necessary \parencite{RespVis}. Doing this is
more advisable than simply extending the width of the chart past the
viewport, since vertical scrolling is easier than horizontal
scrolling. When reducing the width of charts containing annotations, a
number of patterns can be applied to avoid annotations
overlapping. For example, annotations can be removed
\parencite{RespHStackedBar,RespHLineHStackedBar}, simplified, or
relocated \parencite{RespVBar}.

\subsection{Line Charts}
\label{sec:LineChartExamples}

The second most frequent type of responsive charts according to the
responsive visualization gallery
\parencite{DesignPatternsTradeOffsRespVis} are line charts, which
number 98 (= 26\%) out of the 378 responsive visualizations in the
gallery. Line charts are used to show trends in two-dimensional
datasets by plotting them as points connected by lines (a polyline).
They can be extended to compare trends in an additional categorical
dimension by drawing additional polylines for each category. Many line
charts on the web are published in non-responsive forms
\parencite{HLine,HLine2}, although some authors take the extra effort
to make their charts responsive. The minimum which can be done to make
a line chart responsive is to reduce their width
\parencite{RespRadialScatterHLine} on narrower screens by shrinking
the horizontal distance between neighboring points. This usually
occurs together with the recomposition and simplification of
horizontal ticks. If the chart contains annotations, it may also be
necessary to recompose, relocate, and simplify them as well
\parencite{RespHLines,RespHLine,RespHBarHLine,RespHLineHStackedBar}.

A good demonstration of which responsive patterns can be applied to
make a line chart responsive is shown in the responsive line chart
created by \textcite{RespVis} which can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:RespLineExample}. In addition to the recomposition of
ticks, tick labels are rotated to reduce their required horizontal
space. For exceptionally limited space, it can make sense to remove
the axes of a line chart entirely and turn it into a sparkline.
% KA Need a bib entry and ref to sparkline
However, it should be noted that by doing this, the consumer of the
visualization loses information about the type and scale of the
chart's dimensions. This technique should therefore only be applied in
cases where no other pattern is applicable or if the trend in the data
is the most important message to convey. It is rare to encounter
transposed versions of line charts, although transposition could
sometimes benefit heavily annotated line charts
\parencite{VLine}. Applying a transpose pattern would allow the chart
to take up as much vertical space as necessary to neatly accomodate
annotations without requiring the consumer to scroll horizontally.

\subsection{Scatterplots}
\label{sec:ScatterplotExamples}

Scatterplots are also quite frequently encountered among responsive
charts, numbering 26 (= 7\%) of the 378 responsive charts contained in
the gallery by \textcite{DesignPatternsTradeOffsRespVis}. A
scatterplot represents two-dimensional data as points in a 2d
Cartesian coordinate system. There are many examples of scatterplots
published as static images \parencite{Scatter,Scatter2}, with
responsive versions starting to emerge.

The first step to making scatterplots responsive is to reduce their
width to fit them into the space available. As for other types of
chart, care must be taken to avoid overlapping of labels and
annotations by applying recomposition, relocation and simplification
patterns \parencite{RespScatter,RespScatter2}. To counteract the
increased density of points when reducing the size of their container,
various interaction features are usually implemented in scatterplots
which help consumers in making sense of the represented data. The most
useful interaction features in these charts are elaborative zooming
interactions and the explorative panning interactions. In addition to
zooming and panning, \textcite{RespVis} employs additional methods to
ameliorate the overlapping of individual points, including fisheye
distortion, Cartesian distortion, and temporary displacements of
points.

An interesting technique for responsive scatterplots based on the
visualization's density (data points per pixel) rather than its width
was introduced by \textcite{NickRabinowitzRDV}. The benefit of this
approach is that charts adapt to changing amounts of data and
reconfigure their appearance accordingly. The patterns applied in the
responsive scatterplot shown in Figure~\ref{fig:RespScatterExample}
are the recomposition of annotations to only show annotations for
selected data records, and the switching of the encoding from a
scatterplot to a heatmap for high point densities. Other techniques,
such as the recomposition of data records, would also be applicable to
responsive scatterplots, but no examples for such patterns could be
found. If the data to be encoded is inherently cyclic, a radial
scatterplot, using polar coordinates, can be used to better reflect
the cyclic nature of the data \parencite{RespRadialScatterHLine}.

\subsection{Parallel Coordinates}

% KA  How many and % in Kim dataset?

% include Ref to Alfred Inselberg book

Even though parallel coordinates charts are rarely encountered in
non-technical contexts, they are very popular when it comes to
visualizing multidimensional data in visual analytics systems
\parencite{HighD}. In these kinds of charts, multiple dimensions are
rendered as parallel axes, upon which points are connected via paths
(polylines). Each polyline represents a data record and its values at
the corresponding dimensions. The axes of a parallel coordinates chart
are typically laid out horizontally, meaning that the chart can be
made narrower by reducing the distance between individual axes.
Previously mentioned axis-related responsive patterns, such as
rotating labels and recomposing ticks, can also be applied.

Another technique is to temporarily hide some dimensions, based on
some criteria. When automatically hiding dimensions, it is necessary
to apply compensation patterns, giving the user additional controls to
configure which dimensions are displayed and override the system's
hiding behavior. An example of a responsive parallel coordinate chart
incorporating some of these patterns can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:RespParCoordExample}.
%
If reducing the chart's complexity is not appropriate, an alternative
is to transpose the chart, so its dimensions are laid out vertically
and vertical scrolling can be used to explore the full chart.
