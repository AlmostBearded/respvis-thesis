The web is an indispensable part of modern society, and with the ever-growing amounts of available data, visualizations that effectively communicate this data are an essential part of it.
Motivated by the increasing variety of devices used to access the web, responsive design has long since been established as one of the core pillars of designing web content to ensure that it is easily accessible to users regardless of the characteristics of their devices.
Even though most web content is already designed responsively, visualizations are often only embedded in a static form that does not or only minimally adapt to different device characteristics. 
The academic field of responsive visualizations is still in its early stages, but some research from various authors regarding scalable visualizations \parencite{BuildingRespDataVisForTheWeb, LearningRespDataVis}, design patterns \parencite{RespVis, TechniquesForFlexibleRespVisDesign, DesignPatternsTradeOffsRespVis}, and tools \parencite{TechniquesForFlexibleRespVisDesign} was already done and continues to emerge.

Many different software libraries to create visualizations for the web exist, but they all have their shortcomings regarding usability, extensibility, and responsiveness.
One of the most popular libraries for creating visualizations is D3, which provides a low-level API to transform HTML and SVG documents based on data.
This document-based approach is quite powerful as it allows users to create whatever visualizations they wish for without being hindered by the limitations of a custom renderer.
However, building visualizations by manually setting up their entire structure and behavior can be tedious and requires deep knowledge about D3 and the underlying rendering standard like SVG.
Other visualization libraries like Vega \parencite{Vega} focus on a grammar-based approach to rendering visualizations.
Visualization grammars are very expressive and allow users to focus on a visualization's high-level specification, but they tend to be rather complex and are not always easy to understand.
Furthermore, since the actual rendering is abstracted away, visualization authors are limited to the capabilities offered by a library's high-level API, which can lead to configurability restrictions.
Yet other types of visualization libraries are based on template-based configuration, meaning that visualization authors only need to provide data in a predefined format and the library then renders predefined visualizations using this data.
These template-based visualization libraries are usually easy to use, but same as with grammar-based libraries, it can be hard to extend visualizations beyond the intended configuration capabilities.

This thesis introduces RespVis, a new software library for creating presentational information visualizations for the web with a strong emphasis on responsiveness.
RespVis is an open-source library \parencite{RespVisGitHub} that has been designed as an extension of D3 and focuses on rendering visualizations as SVG documents.
Its API has intentionally been kept as minimal as possible and only allows the configuration of data that affects a visualization's content or behavior.
Instead, CSS is used to style and largely position a visualization's content.
The main contribution of this work lies in a custom layouter that uses the browser's own layout engine to enable the positioning of SVG-based visualization components, which would otherwise be unaffected by CSS layouting.
Allowing visualization authors to configure the layout of visualization components with CSS layouting mechanisms like Flexbox and Grid leads to better responsive capabilities than merely allowing them to style components with CSS.
Additionally, the usage of CSS for styling and positioning allows the application of other tools frequently used for responsive design like media queries, and it also means that styles can easily be configured and overwritten via the CSS cascade.
Since RespVis mainly renders and configures visualizations using standardized web technologies such as SVG and CSS, visualization authors can work with technologies all web developers are already familiar with and do not have to learn a complex domain-specific language.
Furthermore, this focus on standardized web technologies also means that visualizations can easily be extended beyond foreseen use cases, meaning that it is less likely that visualization authors are limited by restrictions of the library's API. 

The first part of this thesis, Chapters~\ref{chap:WebTechnologies} to \ref{chap:ResponsiveInformationVisualization}, offers a broad view on other works in the field into which this work is embedded. Chapter~\ref{chap:WebTechnologies} introduces the various web technologies onto which RespVis has been built, the different ways of embedding graphics into web pages, and the different layout engines that have been considered for laying out SVG elements.
Chapter~\ref{chap:InfoVis} gives an overview of the field of information visualization and its history.
Furthermore, some of the more popular software libraries like D3, grammar-based libraries like Vega, and template-based libraries like Highcharts used to create information visualizations for the web are examined and compared regarding their capabilities to make visualizations responsive.
Chapter~\ref{chap:ResponsiveInformationVisualization} further specializes on the research around responsive visualizations.
Specifically, the topic of responsive patterns is introduced, and their application is demonstrated with concrete examples from both academic and other sources. 

The second part of this thesis, Chapters~\ref{chap:RespVis} to \ref{chap:Outlook}, discusses the technical details of RespVis. 
Chapter~\ref{chap:RespVis} introduces the library, its design pillars, naming conventions, and project setup.
Chapter~\ref{chap:Modules} describes RespVis' implementation by examining the different packages and modules into which the library has been split. 
This chapter also discusses the implementation and implications of the custom layouter that enables laying out the elements of SVG-based visualizations using CSS layout mechanisms.
Furthermore, Chapter~\ref{chap:Usage} demonstrates the usage of RespVis' modules to create responsive visualizations and explains how different responsive patterns can be applied to them.
Finally, Chapter~\ref{chap:Outlook} gives an outlook on upcoming topics and potential future work to be done on the library.
