\chapter{Concluding Remarks}
\label{chap:Concl}

This thesis presented RespVis, a new open-source software library to
create responsive visualizations for the web. RespVis is as an
extension of the D3 library, which renders visualizations as composite
SVG documents styled with CSS. The most significant contribution of
this work is a custom layouter, which uses the browser's own layout
engine to enable visualization authors to configure the layout of
SVG-based chart components (such as title, axes, legend, and the chart
itself) via CSS. Media queries can be used in combination with Flexbox
and Grid to position chart components responsively.

Rearranging content in this way is one of the main techniques of
responsive web design. With RespVis, visualization authors can now use
the same tried and trusted techniques to compose and configure
responsive charts. Hence, RespVis is a first step towards easier and
more flexible creation of responsive visualizations.
