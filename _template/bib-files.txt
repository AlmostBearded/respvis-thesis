Andrews Coding Style for Biblatex Entries
=========================================

If you have a large number of bib entries, which can be logically
grouped by topic, then collect them into several separate bib files,
one for each topic.

Within a bib file, group the entries first in decreasing order of
academic importance:

o books (@book)
o book chapters (@incollection)
o journal papers (@article)
o conference papers (@inproceeding)
o theses (@phdthesis, @mastersthesis)
o technical reports (@techreport)
o online resources (@online, @booklet, @misc)

The biblatex documentation describes each entry type and each
field type in great detail:

  http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/biblatex/doc/biblatex.pdf

Within each group, order the entries alphabetically by the surname of
the first author.



Place all field values inside inverted commas "...", not braces {...},
Terminate every field with a comma.

Use braces to preserve an exact form of writing, e.g.
  author       = "Michael {DeBent}",

Edit the title field such that main words are capitalised, e.g.
  title        = "Browsing, Building, and Beholding Cyberspace",

DOIs should be entered without the domain name.
Use the doi field for the official source of the paper
  doi          = "10.1109/INFVIS.1996.559218",

Use the url field for an unofficial source of the paper
(e.g. if the paper is available on the web site of an author)
  url          = "http://ftp.iicm.tugraz.at/pub/papers/ivis96.pdf",

ISBNs should be entered in ISBN-10 format (not ISBN-13)
without any hyphens or punctuation, e.g.
  isbn         = "0387947663",

ISSNs should be entered with a hyphen, e.g.
  issn         = "0001-0782",

page numbers should be separated by a medium dash (--)
  pages         = "166--181",

the venue of a conference (city, town) where held is given in venue field
the location field gives the location of the publisher
  venue         = "Graz, Austria",

Manually shorten any URLs to the minimum length:
try removing "www.", try chopping off URL query parameters, etc.
Do *not* use a URL shortening service.
