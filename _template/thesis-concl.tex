This thesis presented research work in the field of writing a thesis.
The concluding remarks should summarise the contents of the thesis and
underline what is new and original (i.e. the thesis' contribution to
academic progress). This is the opportunity to ``market'' the thesis
and its contributions.

The first chapter introduced the field. Chapters~\ref{chap:Struc} and
\ref{chap:Academic} covered the topics of structuring and preparing an
academic thesis.
%
Chapter~\ref{chap:Style} discussed styles of writing in English. Of
particular note, Section~\ref{sec:EnglishUsage} includes a collated
collection of mistakes often made by non-native English speakers in
computer science Master's theses. Chapter~\ref{chap:Presentation}
provided guidance for giving academic presentations.
Chapter~\ref{chap:Tech} outlined requirements and issues for the
technical production of a thesis. Chapter~\ref{chap:SelectedDetails}
covered specific details of the project which warranted closer
examination.
%
Finally, in Chapter~\ref{chap:Outlook}, the thesis concluded with an
analysis of current trends, an outline of work in progress,
and some ideas for future research.
