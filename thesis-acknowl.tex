I could never have written this thesis without the support of many
people. A huge thank you goes to my supervisor, Prof. Keith Andrews,
who offered guidance and helped me revise this work to a level of
quality far beyond what I could have achieved without him. Thanks to
the Austrian Study Grant Authority for granting me the scholarship
that funded a large amount of the work put into this thesis and
bringing up the leniency when I needed an extension of my deadline. I
am also deeply indebted to my colleagues and friends at Dynatrace for
pushing me forward and giving me the extra hours I needed to finish
this work, even though I know it caused them inconvenience. 

Lastly, words can not express how thankful I am for the support and
understanding my friends and family have shown me over my years of
work on this. Their contribution might be the least visible to readers
of this thesis, but it was, without a doubt, the most valuable.
