\chapter{User Guide}

\label{app:UserGuide}

A thesis in computer science will often involve the writing of
software. In such cases, it is common to have a user guide and
sometimes also a developer guide as appendices.
The user guide is aimed at end users of the software.
It typically covers the following aspects:
\begin{itemize}
\item \liintro{Installation}: a description of how to install the
  software.

\item \liintro{Features}: an overview of what the software can do.

\item \liintro{User Interface}: a thorough tour of elements of the
  user interface, their purpose, and how to use them, illustrated with
  numerous screenshots.

\item \liintro{Usage}: a series of ``recipes'' explaining how to
  accomplish common tasks.

\item \liintro{FAQs}: answers to a number of (anticipated) frequently
  asked questions.
\end{itemize}
The user guide should be a stand-alone document, complete in itself,
even if that requires some duplication with material or screenshots
contained within the main thesis.
